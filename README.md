Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on terrorism attacks involves a systematic examination of data related to incidents, perpetrators, and locations. Through visualizations and statistical techniques, it seeks to identify patterns, trends, and insights, aiding in understanding the nature and impact of terrorism. EDA can uncover hotspots, frequency of attacks, casualty trends, and more, helping governments, security agencies, and researchers make informed decisions and develop counter-terrorism strategies.
